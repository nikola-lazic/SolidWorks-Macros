### **Custom Property Builder**
This macro is used when new part is created. Before using, we have to save part.
- It will create Bounding Box and fill the data into Custom Property
- Dimensions will be written in this format: thickness x width x length

### **Save as PDF**
Open drawing and just run this macro and it will save that drawing into **PDF** format at the same location where the SolidWorks drawing is saved.

### **Save as JPG**
Open drawing and just run this macro and it will save that drawing into **JPG** format at the same location where the SolidWorks drawing is saved. Maybe it's better to rewrite this into **TIFF** format.
</br>TIFF is much better that JPG and you could save more detailed images.
